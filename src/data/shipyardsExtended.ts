    story: "The story of Reborn Yachts began with childhood pals Bart Reijn and Maarten van den Born, the driving force behind this innovative brand. Both have been involved in the marine industry throughout their careers, Maarten in yacht building, and Bart with his own watersport company called Reijn's Boten. Maarten joined Bart in 2010, and together they successfully grew the business.\n\nThe ambition was always to set up their own boat brand, and in 2018 they took the plunge by starting Reborn Yachts. Together with an experienced team of professionals, including Sea Level Naval Architects, Bernd Weel Design, Nedcam, and Adel Polyester, they started working towards their ultimate goal. By mid-2020, the plugs and moulds were ready, and by the end of the year, the first hull was under construction. The first yacht was launched in the summer of 2021: The Reborn Cabin 38, followed by the other members of the exciting Reborn fleet: the Bowrider 38 and 40R.",
